# Stack Data Structure

A *push-down stack*, or *stack* for short, is a list in which all insertions and deletions occur at only one end, in this case called the *top* of the stack - the other end is the *bottom*. The list elements enter and leave the stack in a **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** or **First-In, Last-Out (FILO)** order.

## Standard Stack Operations
- `push(): Inserts an element on the stack. If there is no place for a new element, the stack gets in overflow state.`

- `pop(): Returns and removes an element from the top of the stack. If there are no elements, the stack gets in an underflow state.`

- `isEmpty(): Checks whether the stack is empty or not.`

- `isFull(): Checks whether the stack is full or not.`

- `peek(): Accesses the element at the i-th position.`

- `count(): Counts the number of elements in the stack.`

- `change(): Overrides an element at the i-th position.`

- `display(): Displays all the elements in the stack.`
